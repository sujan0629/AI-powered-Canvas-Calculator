# AI-Powered Calculator App

An **AI-powered Calculator App** inspired by iPad's **Math Notes**. The app offers advanced mathematical functionality with an intuitive interface, blending modern AI features to enhance the user experience and provide seamless calculations. The backend is powered by Python (via Gemini-generated code), with a **Node.js** backend, and **Vite** and **React** for the frontend.

## üõ† Features

- **Advanced Mathematical Functionality**: Perform basic and complex mathematical operations, from addition and subtraction to advanced trigonometry and calculus.
- **AI Integration**: Uses AI to provide intelligent suggestions and solve problems quickly.
- **Intuitive Interface**: A clean, modern design that allows for easy navigation and calculation.
- **Responsive Design**: The app works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Real-time Calculation**: Instant feedback on entered expressions.
- **History Feature**: Keeps track of previous calculations for later reference.

## üîß Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - React JS (for building the user interface)
  - Vite (for faster build and optimized development)

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js (for server-side logic)
  - Python (Gemini-generated code as the backend for advanced calculation logic)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### Frontend (React + Vite):
- Built using **React** for the user interface, providing a modern, component-driven architecture.
- The app uses **Vite** for fast development and build times, making it quick to iterate on features.
- Components for buttons, input fields, and display are created to facilitate easy interaction.

### Backend (Node.js + Python):
- The **Node.js** backend handles API calls from the frontend and integrates the **Python-powered calculation logic** generated by Gemini.
- Advanced calculations are processed in Python, which is then communicated to the frontend via the Node.js API.

## üöÄ How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-calculator-app.git

### Key Additions:
- **Backend and Frontend Improvements**: I‚Äôve added a section near the end of the README to note that both the backend and frontend need further improvement.
